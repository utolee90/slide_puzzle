# 3x3 Slide Puzzle by React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to play the game
This project builds an example of slide puzzle. 
* You can play the game by clicking the square next to the empty square. Then the square will move to empty square.
* When the puzzle is arranged, "Game Clear!" message appears.
* You can also move the block by putting the *position number* of the block which you want to move. The number of position is given as below table.
  <table border="1px solid">
  <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>
  </table>
* You can play another game by pressing "Shuffle" button.

## Available Scripts (For Developers)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
